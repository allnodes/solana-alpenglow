## Modifications made by Allnodes

This repository features the following enhancements to the Jito-Solana codebase:

### 1. Fast snapshot distribution

✅ Only on [Allnodes Bare-Metal Servers](https://www.allnodes.com/hosting/solana)

Our infrastructure includes modifications that improve default snapshot downloading, which combined with
ultra-high-speed channels deliver ultra-fast snapshot downloads. This dramatically reduces the initial sync time for
new validators and enables faster deployment and recovery scenarios. The use of snapshot-finder or any other 3rd party
download tools is no longer needed.

### 2. Hardware-optimized SHA256 patch

Our validator implementation includes a third-party performance patch developed by **kagren**. It optimizes SHA256
hashing operations using SHA-NI instructions available on modern AMD processors (Zen3, Zen4, and Zen5
architectures). This enhancement significantly improves hashing performance for block verification and other
cryptographic operations.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

The `rust-toolchain.toml` file pins a specific rust version and ensures that
cargo commands run with that version. Note that cargo will automatically install
the correct version if it is not already installed.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libclang-dev curl git
```

On Fedora:
```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core libclang-dev curl git
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/allnodes/solana-alpenglow
$ cd solana-alpenglow
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this builds a debug version that is **not suitable for running a testnet or mainnet validator**. Please read [`docs/src/cli/install.md`](docs/src/cli/install.md#build-from-source) for instructions to build a release version for test and production uses.

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo nextest run --profile ci  --cargo-profile ci --config-file .config/nextest.toml
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.anza.xyz/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

* `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.anza.xyz/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it's a *solution* to
some problem.  Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of *problems* the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn't *infringe* on anyone else's solutions. Adding a
test *protects* your solution from future changes. Say you don't understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, "what
problem is solved by this code?" On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it's protecting, please
send us that patch!
